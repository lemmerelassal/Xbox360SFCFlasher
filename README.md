# Xbox360SFCFlasher
This program allows you to flash the NAND flash of the Xbox 360 using the SPI port of the SMC. This will only work if the SMC is up and running (i.e.: the SMC code on the NAND flash is uncorrupted).

# Requirements
This program is written for use with FT4232H (although it will probably also work using FT2232H).

# Changelog
28/08/2011 - Initial release
